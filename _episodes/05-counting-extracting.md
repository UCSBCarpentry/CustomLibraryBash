##  Counting and mining data

Now that you know how to navigate the shell, we will move onto
learning how to count and mine data using a few of the standard shell commands.
While these commands are unlikely to revolutionise your work by themselves,
they're very versatile and will add to your foundation for working in the shell
and for learning to code. The commands also replicate the sorts of uses library users might make of library data.

## Counting and sorting

We will begin by counting the contents of files using the Unix shell.
We can use the Unix shell to quickly generate counts from across files,
something that is tricky to achieve using the graphical user interfaces of standard office suites.

Let's start by navigating to the directory that contains our data using the
`cd` command:

~~~
$ cd shell-lesson
~~~
{: .bash}

Remember, if at any time you are not sure where you are in your directory structure,
use the `pwd` command to find out:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
/Users/your.username/Desktop/shell-lesson/data
~~~
{: .output}

And let's just check what files are in the directory and how large they
are with `ls -lhS`:

~~~
$ ls -lhs
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
 total 6.6M
384K -rw-r--r-- 1 your.username 1049089 384K Mar 12 16:25 000003160_01_text.json

In this episode we'll focus on the datasets in the desktracker  
directory, that contains four .csv Desktracker files.

> ## CSV and TSV Files
> CSV (Comma-separated values) is a common plain text format for storing tabular
> data, where each record occupies one line and the values are separated by commas.
> TSV (Tab-separated values) is just the same except that values are separated by
> tabs rather than commas. Confusingly, CSV is sometimes used to refer to both CSV,
> TSV and variations of them. The simplicity of the formats make them great for
> exchange and archival. They are not bound to a specific program (unlike Excel
> files, say, there is no `CSV` program, just lots and lots of programs that
> support the format, including Excel by the way.), and you wouldn't have any
> problems opening a 40 year old file today if you came across one.

<!-- hm, reminds me of MARC -->

First, let's have a look at the the 2016 file, using the tools we 
learned in
[Reading files]({{ page.root }}/03-working-with-files-and-folders/#reading-files):

~~~
$ cat Desk_Tracker.csv
~~~
{: .bash}

Like `829-0.txt` before, the whole dataset cascades by and can't really make any
sense of that amount of text. To cancel this on-going con`cat`enation, or indeed any
process in the Unix shell, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

In most data files a quick glimpse of the first few lines already tells us a lot
about the structure of the dataset, for example the table/column headers:

~~~
$ head -n 3 Desk_Tracker.csv

In the header, we can see the common metadata fields of Desktracker: 
`user`, `Contact Type`, `library'.

Next, let's learn about a basic data analysis tool:
`wc` is the "word count" command: it counts the number of lines, words, and bytes.
Since we love the wildcard operator, let's run the command
`wc *.csv` to get counts for all the `.csv` files in the Desktrackers 
directory.
(it takes a little time to complete):

~~~~
$ wc *.csv  
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
   122995   2171893  54797588 Desk_Tracker.csv
    43842    757941  18654589 Desk_Tracker_2016.csv
    31456    565013  12271344 Desk_Tracker_2017.csv
    27274    491149   9833562 Desk_Tracker_2018.csv
    20426    358164   6947675 Desk_Tracker_2019.csv
   245993   4344160 102504758 total
~~~
{: .output}

The first three columns contains the number of lines, words and bytes.

If we only have a handful of files to compare, it might be faster or more convenient
to just check with Microsoft Excel, OpenRefine or your favourite text editor, but
when we have tens, hundreds or thousands of documents, the Unix shell has a clear
speed advantage. The real power of the shell comes from being able to combine commands
and automate tasks, though. We will touch upon this slightly.

For now, we'll see how we can build a simple pipeline to find the shortest file
in terms of number of lines. We start by adding the `-l` flag (this looks 
confusing in the shell, but this is a lower-case letter L, not the number one) to get 
only the number of lines, not the number of words and bytes:

~~~~
$ wc -l *.csv
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
   122995 Desk_Tracker.csv
    43842 Desk_Tracker_2016.csv
    31456 Desk_Tracker_2017.csv
    27274 Desk_Tracker_2018.csv
    20426 Desk_Tracker_2019.csv
   245993 total
~~~
{: .output}

The `wc` command itself doesn't have a flag to sort the output, but as we'll
see, we can combine three different shell commands to get what we want.

First, we have the `wc -l *.csv` command. We will save the output from 
this command in a new file. To do that, we *redirect* the output from the 
command to a file using the ‘greater than’ sign (>), like so:

~~~
$ wc -l *.csv > lengths.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

There's no output now since the output went into the file `lengths.txt`, but
we can check that the output indeed ended up in the file using `cat` or `less`
(or Notepad or any text editor).

~~~~
$ cat lengths.txt
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
   122995 Desk_Tracker.csv
    43842 Desk_Tracker_2016.csv
    31456 Desk_Tracker_2017.csv
    27274 Desk_Tracker_2018.csv
    20426 Desk_Tracker_2019.csv
   245993 total
~~~
{: .output}

Next, there is the `sort` command. We'll use the `-n` flag to specify that we
want numerical sorting, not lexical sorting, we output the results into
yet another file, and we use `cat` to check the results:

~~~~
$ sort -n lengths.txt > sorted-lengths.txt
$ cat sorted-lengths.txt
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
    20426 Desk_Tracker_2019.csv
    27274 Desk_Tracker_2018.csv
    31456 Desk_Tracker_2017.csv
    43842 Desk_Tracker_2016.csv
   122995 Desk_Tracker.csv
~~~
{: .output}

Finally we have our old friend `head`, that we can use to get the first 
line of the `sorted-lengths.txt`:
(Earlier, we had the issue of is this a lower case L or a number one. 
Here, its the number 1 because the '-n' is for sorting lines, and we want the number)
~~~~
$ head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
   20426 Desk_Tracker_2019.csv
~~~
{: .output}

But we're really just interested in the end result, not the intermediate
results now stored in `lengths.txt` and `sorted-lengths.txt`. What if we could
send the results from the first command (`wc -l *.csv`) directly to the 
next
command (`sort -n`) and then the output from that command to `head -n 1`?
Luckily we can, using a concept called pipes. On the command line, you make a
pipe with the vertical bar character `|`. Let's try with one pipe first:

~~~~
$ wc -l *.csv | sort -n
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
    20426 Desk_Tracker_2019.csv
    27274 Desk_Tracker_2018.csv
    31456 Desk_Tracker_2017.csv
    43842 Desk_Tracker_2016.csv
   122995 Desk_Tracker.csv
   245993 total
~~~
{: .output}

Notice that this is exactly the same output that ended up in our `sorted-lengths.txt`
earlier. Let's add another pipe:

~~~~
$ wc -l *.csv | sort -n | head -n 1
~~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
   20426 Desk_Tracker_2019.csv
~~~
{: .output}

It can take some time to fully grasp pipes and use them efficiently, but it's a
very powerful concept that you will find not only in the shell, but also in most
programming languages.

> This programming model is called “pipes and filters”. We’ve already seen pipes; a

> stream of output. Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way: unless

## Extracting data from DeskTracker
 For instance, say we want to retain only the `response_set_id`, `date_time`, `Question Type`, and `Contact
 Type` columns from our article data. With `cut` we'd:
